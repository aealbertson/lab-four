### SETUP:
>Create another website - this time, responsive!  

### TASK:
>Your webiste is going to be pretty image heavy. Here's what we need to see:

1. 4 rows of images, 4 images per row
2. Each image should have a heading
3. Each image should have a caption
4. Each image should have a border, padding, and margin
5. A header
6. A footer
7. At least 2 media queries

Images should reformat based on the size of the viewport. Some styling should change based on the size of the viewport (ex. border color around image changes basedon screen size).
